# Book Store Management System


This project is a web application designed for managing a bookstore, handling book sales and rentals. The system allows the admin to track total sales, manage the book database by adding new books, deleting books, and updating the status of books (e.g., available for sale, rented out, sold). Additionally, the system displays a chart showing the net profit from sales and rentals.
